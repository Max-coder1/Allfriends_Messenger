             your device and other technical data about your device. When you install the Application, 
             you may also grant the mobile application permission to collect certain types of information via a permission

             permission screen consent process – it is typically run by your mobile operating system; HOWEVER, ONCE SUCH 
             PERMISSION IS GRANTED BY YOU ON AN OPT-IN BASIS, WE MAY COLLECT SOME, BUT NOT ALL, OF THE INFORMATION THAT A

             BROWSER HISTORY, COUNTRY, ZIP CODE AND DEVICE IDS (INCLUDING IMEI, DEVICE SERIAL NUMBER AND MAC ADDRESS)

             may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Service. 
             For example, we may collect one of the unique identifiers associated with your mobile device as listed above and 
             demographic or interest preference information from other companies and combine that with information we collect 
             through the Service to allow our customers to deliver advertisements that may be of interest to you on your mobile 
             device or to identify you on other devices or browsers. We anonymize all Personal Information on your device before 
             collecting it.
